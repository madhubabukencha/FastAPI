# Implementing a FastAPI Web Server with Uvicorn

## What is a Web Server?
A web server is software that handles HTTP requests from clients 
(like browsers or mobile apps) and serves responses (typically HTML 
pages or API data). It's the foundation of any web application, 
responsible for processing incoming requests and returning appropriate 
responses.

## FastAPI and ASGI Servers
FastAPI is a modern Python web framework that doesn't include its
own web server. Instead, it uses the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway
Interface) specification, which is the asynchronous successor to WSGI. 
ASGI servers handle the low-level network operations while FastAPI 
focuses on application logic.

By default, FastAPI applications are served using Uvicorn, a lightweight
ASGI server implementation. Uvicorn is particularly well-suited for FastAPI
because it supports asynchronous request handling, which aligns with 
FastAPI's async capabilities.

## Implementation Guide

Here's how to implement and run a FastAPI application with Uvicorn:

1. First, install the required packages:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

2. Create a FastAPI application file (e.g., `main.py`):
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

3. You have several options to run the server:

### Option 1: Using Uvicorn directly in code
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```
Then run with:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Using Uvicorn from command line
For production:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

For development (with auto-reload):
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Option 3: Using FastAPI CLI (as mentioned in your documentation)
For production:
```bash
fastapi run main.py
```

For development (with auto-reload):
```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```

## Testing the API

After starting the server, you can test the endpoint in several ways:

1. Using `curl` in a new terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

2. Visiting in a web browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/health
```

3. Using FastAPI's automatic documentation:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Key Notes

- The `--reload` flag (or `fastapi dev`) enables auto-reloading when code changes, which is ideal for development
- For production, you should use a process manager like Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers for better stability
- The default port is 8000, but you can change it with the `--port` option
- `host="0.0.0.0"` makes the server accessible on your network, while the default `127.0.0.1` only allows local access

This implementation provides a solid foundation for building and running FastAPI applications with proper web server support.
